# PYTHON_DataStructureVisualizer_Stack-QueueSimulator_Proj_Sean
This is an interactive educational application built with Python's Tkinter library that provides visual representations of two fundamental data structures: Stack and Queue. The application allows users to perform operations on these data structures and see real-time visual feedback.
Key Features
üèóÔ∏è Data Structures Implemented
Stack: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure with push, pop, and peek operations

Queue: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure with enqueue, dequeue, and front operations

üé® Visual Elements
Interactive Canvas: Real-time visualization of data structures

Color-coded Elements: Different colors for top/front elements vs regular elements

Animated Operations: Visual feedback during operations with color changes

Pointer Indicators: Clear labels for stack top, queue front, and queue rear

Structure Switching: Seamless toggle between stack and queue views

‚ö° Core Functionality
Stack Operations:

Push: Add elements to the top

Pop: Remove elements from the top

Peek: View the top element without removal

Queue Operations:

Enqueue: Add elements to the rear

Dequeue: Remove elements from the front

Front: View the front element without removal

üñ•Ô∏è User Interface Components
Structure Selection: Radio buttons to switch between stack and queue

Input Field: Text entry for adding elements (supports Enter key)

Operation Buttons: Color-coded buttons for each data structure operation

Status Display: Real-time information about current state and size

Information Panel: Operation feedback and messages

üîß Technical Implementation
Object-Oriented Design: Separate classes for Stack, Queue, and Visualizer

Error Handling: Input validation and empty structure warnings

Visual Feedback: Highlighting of specific elements during peek/front operations

Responsive Design: Clean layout with appropriate spacing and colors

Educational Value
This application serves as an excellent learning tool for:

Computer science students understanding data structures

Visual learners who benefit from seeing operations in action

Beginners learning about LIFO vs FIFO concepts

Developers wanting to understand stack and queue implementations

Usage
Select either Stack or Queue using the radio buttons

Enter values in the input field

Use the operation buttons to manipulate the data structure

Watch the visual representation update in real-time

View status information and operation feedback
